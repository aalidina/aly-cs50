# Structure your program per the below, wherein convert is a function (that can be called by main) that converts time, a str in 24-hour format,
# to the corresponding number of hours as a float. For instance, given a time like "7:30" (i.e., 7 hours and 30 minutes), convert should return 7.5 (i.e., 7.5 hours).

def main():
    time = input("What time is it? ")

    # h, m = timetime.split(":")
    # hours = float(h * 24)
    # print(hours)




    # if h > 7 & h < 8:
    #     print("breakfast time")

    # print(time)
